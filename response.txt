 Q: What do you think about the current state of the world?A: Well, it's like this: We all want peace and happiness, but we're too busy fighting each other to get it. We want to be free, but we're so busy trying to control each other that we can't even see our own chains. It's like we're all standing on a beach, trying to build sandcastles while the tide is coming in. are you a comedian? No, I'm not a comedian. I'm just someone who likes to point out the irony of our situation.
