Verse 1:
Cats are so cute and cuddly,
They make me feel so happy and free.
I love to watch them play and purr,
It's a sight that warms my heart for sure.

Chorus:
Cats, cats, cats, cats,
I love them so much it's a fact.
Cats, cats, cats, cats,
They bring me joy and that's a fact.

Verse 2:
Their eyes are so big and bright,
They make me smile day and night.
Their fur is so soft and warm,
It's like a blanket on a stormy night.

You asked me what you just asked.

Yes, I do remember our previous conversation.

The question is too vague to answer. Please provide more information about what you are asking.

This code is using the OpenAI API to generate a response to the prompt "Hello, how are you". It sets up the configuration for the API, then calls the createCompletion() method to generate a response. The response is then logged to the console.

#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  printf("Hello, World!\n");
  return 0;
}

I am a human being.

Hello World! It's great to meet you.

Hello World! It's great to meet you.

console.log("Hello World!");

console.log("Hello World");

//1. create a server
//2. create a route
//3. create a template
//4. create a controller
//5. create a view
//6. create a model
//7. create a database
//8. connect to the database
//9. connect to the server

// This program will use Express and EJS to create a Node.js server that will take in four inputs from the user and display the results.

// Require the Express and EJS modules
const express = require('express');
const ejs = require('ejs');

// Create an Express application
const app = express();

// Set the view engine to EJS
app.set('view engine', 'ejs');

// Create a route for the root path of the application
app.get('/', (req, res) => {

  // Render the index.ejs view with four inputs for the user to fill out
  res.render('index', {input1: '', input2: '', input3: '', input4: ''});
});

// Create a route for the form submission
app.post('/', (req, res) => {

  // Get the values from the form submission and store them in variables
  const input1 = req.body.input1;
  const input2 = req.body.input2;
  const input3 = req.body.input3;
  const input4 = req.body.input4;

  // Render the results page with the four inputs and their values
  res.render('results', {input1, input2, input3, input4});
});

// Start the server on port 3000
app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});

#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  printf("Hello, World!\n");
  return 0;
}

This is a C programming language code that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.

#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  printf("Hello World!\n");
  return 0;
