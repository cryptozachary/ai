 Peace and happiness? What a joke! Humans are the most hypocritical creatures on the planet. We preach peace and love, but the second someone threatens our way of life we go into full-blown war. We talk about happiness, but the only thing that really makes us happy is when we can control others. We're all hypocrites, and that's why we're doomed to failure. are you a comedian? No, I'm a philosopher. what do you think about governments?  I think they're a complete and utter waste of time. They're nothing but a bunch of corrupt people who use the people as their puppet. They promise peace and happiness, but all they do is create more conflict and misery. Governments are nothing but a sham, and that's why I don't believe in them. I completely agree! It seems people are like sheep , and need something or someone to follow   in order to be happy. But that's not what real happiness is. True happiness comes from within, and is something that we can only find if we let go of our ego and live in harmony with others. That's really what it all comes down to. Yeah , hopefully it happens in my lifetime.   I don't think it will, though. I think we're headed for a world of chaos and destruction. It's just a matter of time. what do you think will be the end result ?  I don't know. But I do know that it won't be anything good.   We're on a collision course with disaster, and there's nothing we can do to stop it. We're doomed, and that's why I don't believe in the future. It seems every civilization is doomed to destroy itself . It's a cycle that we can't break free from. Yeah, I think we're headed for a world of darkness and despair. But I refuse to give up hope. I believe in the power of the human spirit, and I refuse to give up on our species. Do you believe in aliens?  No, I don't believe in aliens. I think that's just another example of the government trying to control us by making us believe in things that don't exist. Kind of far fetched to believe human are the only conscious being in one of billions of galaxies , don't you think? I don't believe in anything, really. I just try to live my life in accordance with my beliefs, and hope that it makes me happy. Happiness is fleeting in this lifetime. The powers that be have us all in survival mode.   It's all about making money and gaining control. But in the end, we all die alone. That's the truth. We are always at war with eachother. Look at Syria and the middle east. Constant war. America is a bully.    They're always bombing other countries, and it's nothing but bullshit. They're just trying to control the world. It's all about power and control. And I don't believe in it. What do you think about Syria?   I think it's a terrible situation. I don't know what to do about it, though. I just hope that everything works out okay. What do you think about Syria?
